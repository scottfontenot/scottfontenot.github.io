**Today's Progress**

- [x] ex11: Asking Questions 

```python
# end=' ' puts a space after the " ? " AND doesn't go to a newline.
print("How old are you?", end=' ')

# pass age to repr() to get python type
age = input()
print(">> age=", repr(age))

```
- [x] ex12: Prompting People. In powershell, type "python -m pydoc input". Look what pydoc command does. **input() string has no trailing newline**
```python
#ask a question and get an answer in one line
age = input("How old are you? ")
```
- [x] ex13: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables. The **argv** is the *argument variable*, it holds the arguments you pass to your Python script. Call your script by naming the script and  passing the arguments.

```python
#this line unpack...Take whatever is in argv, unpack it, and assign it to all of these variables on the left in order.
script, first, second, third = argv
```
- [x] ex14: Prompting and Passing. input(prompt)
```python
print(f"Do you like me {user_name}")
likes = input(prompt)
```
- [x] ex15: Reading Files
```python
# print out contents of a file
txt = open(filename)
print(f"Here's your file{filename}: ")
print(txt.read())
```
**Thoughts:**  Ok, so this was a lot of unpack from asking user questions, assigning that to variables, unpacking and passing arguments, and reading files.
