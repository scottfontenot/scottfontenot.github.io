**Today's Progress**: exercises 0 through 6. 
- [x] ex0: The setup
- [x] ex1: A Good First Program
- [x] ex2: Comments and Pound Characters
- [x] ex3: Numbers and Math. You can do math with print commands! also get boolean responses

```python
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)
>>> 97

print(3 + 2< 5 -7)
>>> False
```

- [x] ex4: Variables and Names. Floating points (4.0) are just numbers with a decimal
- [x] ex5: More Variables and Printing. The **f** means **format** and it's there to tell python "Hey this string needs to be formatted"

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Your name is {name}.")
```

**Thoughts:** Basic stuff so far. No surprises which is a good thing considering I have coded some python before.
