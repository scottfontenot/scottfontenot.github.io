**Today's Progress**

- [x] ex19: Functions and Variables. 

```python
def cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers):
    print(">>> cheese_count=", cheese_count, "boxes_of_crackers=", boxes_of_crackers)
    print(f"You have {cheese_count} cheeses!")
    print(f"You have {boxes_of_crackers} boxes of crackers!")
    print("Man that's enough for a party!")
    print("Get a blanket.\n")
# where the function ends
    print("<<< exit cheese_and_crackers")
```

**Thoughts:** I lost track of time between the last update, super focused on actual paying work. Anyway, this was nice function practice exercise. The biggest takeaway here is to get into the practice of writing print statements inside the function as this will become handy when functions are chained.
