**Today's Progress**

- [x] ex6: Strings and Text. f-strings
- [x] ex7: More Printing. Need to repeat a string 10 times

```python
print("." * 10)
```

- [x] ex8: Printing, Printing. Using the format function to pass variables into other strings.

```python
formatter = "{} {} {} {}"
print(formatter.format(1,2,3,4))
```

- [x] ex9: Printing, Printing, Printing. Ways to make a string that goes across multiple lines. \n means new line; Using ''' quote blocks to print.
- [x] ex10: What was that? The escape character "\". \t means tab

**Thoughts:** I think I'm following along so far. This was a lot about how to manipulate strings.
